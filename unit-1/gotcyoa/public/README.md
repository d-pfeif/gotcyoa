# Game of Thrones CYOA

This is a choose your own adventure game set in the Game of Thrones world. The purpose of this game is to immerse people in George R.R. Martin's fantasy world while they wait for the next season to come out. I was motivated to make this because I'm a fan of the show and wanted a chance to get creative.

Below is the current main page.

## Features/Objectives

The game's objective is to kill the king before you die. There's several features this app has:
+ People Killed
+ Inventory List
+ Allies
+ Secret Passages

These features are present on the screen and can be viewed at any time.

There's also a randomly generated House + their house words (if there are any) every time you choose an option.

The API used was [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)

There are currently only 3 endings: one main ending and two optionally endings. The two optional endings are unlocked by completing certain tasks.
